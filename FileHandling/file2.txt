FILE HANDLING IN PYTHON IS A BREEZE,
OPEN A FILE, READ WITH EASE.
USE 'WITH' TO SAFELY OPEN THE GATE,
SO YOU DONÂ€™T FORGET TO CLOSE IT LATE.

TRY TO READ A FILE THATÂ€™S THERE,
BUT WHAT IF IT'S GONE? DO YOU DARE?
CATCH THE ERROR WITH TRY AND EXCEPT,
YOUR PROGRAM WON'T CRASH Â€” IT'S PREPPED!

YOU CAN READ, WRITE, OR EVEN APPEND,
JUST PICK THE MODE, MY CODING FRIEND.
AND IF YOUR FILE'S TOO BIG TO CHEW,
READ LINE BY LINE Â€” THAT'S WHAT PROS DO!

ALWAYS REMEMBER TO HANDLE EXCEPTIONS RIGHT,
SO BUGS DONÂ€™T CREEP IN LATE AT NIGHT.
WITH PYTHONÂ€™S TOOLS SO NEATLY PACKED,
YOUR FILE SKILLS WILL STAY ON TRACK!
