File handling in Python is a breeze,
Open a file, read with ease.
Use 'with' to safely open the gate,
So you don’t forget to close it late.

Try to read a file that’s there,
But what if it's gone? Do you dare?
Catch the error with try and except,
Your program won't crash — it's prepped!

You can read, write, or even append,
Just pick the mode, my coding friend.
And if your file's too big to chew,
Read line by line — that's what pros do!

Always remember to handle exceptions right,
So bugs don’t creep in late at night.
With Python’s tools so neatly packed,
Your file skills will stay on track!
